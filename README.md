Feature Breakdown

Project scope/stage	Project description	Team size	Team Roles
Discovery/PoC
A proof of concept (PoC) is a small-scale project that helps you test the feasibility of your software idea without committing to a full-blown development. PoC is not a market-ready product.

Up to 5 specialists

Product owner (usually on the client’s side), project manager, business analyst, UI/UX designer, and at least one software developer, depending on the complexity of a PoC.

MVP development
A minimum viable product (MVP) is an early product version that is limited to the core features and functionality. You can release MVP to the market and elicit user feedback to improve your offering.

6+ specialists

Product owner (usually on the client’s side), project manager, business analyst, UI/UX designer, software engineers, test engineers

Product development
A full-blown product with all its intended features and functionality

Agile: usually up to nine specialists; if a project is large-scale, several Agile teams may work together.

Waterfall: no team size limit; the specific headcount will depend on the type and complexity of an application

Product owner (usually on the client’s side), project manager, business analyst, UI/UX designer, software architect, software engineers, test engineers.

Optionally: test automation engineers, performance engineers, DevOps engineers, security engineers

To optimize the software development process, costs, and team composition, you could use low-code and no-code solutions. However, even the simplest software products built with such tools require a business analyst and a software engineer; without technical expertise, you won’t be able to map business requirements against the product’s feature set and configure the components appropriately. Additionally, low-code and no-code development tools are best suited for PoC and MVP projects.



Deadline
How quickly you need to turn your product around will influence the team structure and size, too. Quite obviously, with fewer team members, it may take longer to complete the project. So, if you have an idea of a state-of-the-art product that needs to be developed from scratch and on a tight deadline, you might have to assemble an extended team of senior engineers or a group of full-stack engineers who will be able to cover all needs and deliver results quickly and efficiently.

Development budget
Being inextricably intertwined with the factors above, the available budget would certainly affect every decision you make—from how many team members you can hire to the seniority of specialists you can bring in to how feature-rich your product can be when turned around. To reduce project expenses without sacrificing quality at the initial stages of development, consider opting for any of the Agile project management methodologies. You could deliver in increments, focusing on high-priority features first, and have more cost flexibility.

Software development approach
Whether you opt for Waterfall or Agile would directly impact your workflows and a software development team structure. A project management methodology you choose to go with shapes up the size of your team, the responsibilities of team members, and the relations within the team. Let’s catch up on the key facts about Waterfall and Agile and see how their peculiarities are reflected in the development team composition.

Waterfall	Agile
Software development process	
The development process is divided into distinct sequential phases

The development process is broken down into two to four-week sprints

Project scope	
The scope is defined in advance. Changes are usually limited

Scope changes are expected and allowed during the development

Client involvement	
Requires clients to be available at milestones for deliverables acceptance

Requires clients participation throughout the project

Feature prioritization	
Features are prioritized at the start of a project on a WBS basis

Features are prioritized at the start of each sprint and issues are managed according to priorities

Focus and mindset	
Project mindset. The focus is on accomplishing the project

Product mindset. The focus is on delivering value for the customer

Quality assurance	
Software testing follows software engineering

Testing is performed in parallel with the development

Pricing model	
Risks are lower with Fixed Price

Works well with Time & Material
